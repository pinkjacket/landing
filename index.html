      <h4>This is a complete list of projects on my github. They're mostly just practice things, and few of them currently have github pages sites set up.</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/hello-world">hello-world</a>
          <p>The first project at Epicodus. It just says hello in a few languages, and I think it was actually all copy-pasted code to introduce us to the concept of HTML. Done in HTML.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/goodbye">goodbye</a>
          <p>Second Epicodus project. This one says goodbye in several languages, the last two of which were actually added by me and a partner. Done in HTML.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/cookie-recipe">cookie-recipe</a>
          <p>Third Epicodus project. Since these are listed in chronological order I may stop numbering them. It's a cookie recipe that needed some cleanup for readability. Done in HTML.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/my-first-webpage">my-first-webpage</a>
          <p>This actually contains two pages, and involved more hands-on work than the previous projects and the use of images. Done in HTML.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/new-website">new-website</a>
          <p>A list of some music genres and musicians, with pictures. Also has a second page with a list of movies. First project to use CSS, also first to contain a README file. Done in HTML with CSS.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/resort-website">resort-website</a>
          <p>A website for a terrible hotel. Practice for branching and merging. Done in HTML with CSS.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/cupcake_shop">cupcake_shop</a>
          <p>A page for a cupcake bakery. Practice for using CSS classes to style HTML elements. Done in HTML with CSS.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/boring-lecture">boring-lecture</a>
          <p>A boring lecture composed mostly of lorem ipsum. It's ostensibly about the Hawley Smoot Tariff Act, which is the subject of Ben Stein's lecture in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, chosen by John Hughes because it was the most boring awful adult subject he could think of. Further CSS styling practice. Done in HTML with CSS.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/band">band</a>
          <p>A brief page about the Pet Shop Boys, my favorite band, with photos. Intended as float practice, we also ended up incorporating columns a lesson early to keep the pictures and text from overlapping. Done in HTML with CSS.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/blog">blog</a>
          <p>A small blog mockup. Mostly lorem ipsum, done for practice with things like margins and padding. Also contains a gif that you used to find on a lot of blogs. A tooltip was also attempted but we couldn't quite get it to work. Done in HTML with CSS.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/petsite">petsite</a>
          <p>An animal adoption website done to practice cascading and media queries. Done in HTML with CSS.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/vacation">vacation</a>
          <p>A website advertising vacations to scenic Europa, theoretically-inhabitable ice moon of Jupiter. Done as an introduction to using Bootstrap. Done in HTML with CSS and Bootstrap.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/wiki">wiki</a>
          <p>An attempt to recreate the front page of Wikipedia using Bootstrap. It's mising the nav bar and a few other things, but I think it came out all right for a first try. Done in HTML with CSS and Bootstrap.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/pinkjacket/landing">landing</a>
          <p>The repository for this page, right here. Weird feeling, right? Done in HTML with CSS and Bootstrap.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4 background">
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>I recently (last year) graduated from PSU with a bachelor's degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice. While I maintain an interest in the subject, I'm not sure I'm cut out for most of the work the degree qualifies me for, such as law enforcement. In October I came to a free Saturday class at Epicodus and found I enjoyed it a lot, so now here I am.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 interests">
          <h4>Interests</h4>
          <p>I spend a lot of time online. I mostly use Twitter these days. I have a mildly popular Tumblr but these days it's really just a queue of funny pictures, I like interacting with people more on Twitter.</p>
          <p>I also enjoy videogames, movies and TV, and reading. I'm a big media guy, I guess. I'm currently trying to learn to draw, and when I'm farther along in my coding knowledge I hope to try my hand at making a game or two.</p>
          <p>Also, I know a decent amount about food history and a <strong>LOT</strong> about organized crime, a small amount of which can be seen to the right.</p>
